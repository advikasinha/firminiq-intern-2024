# Internship Work at FIRMINIQ

This repository contains all the work I completed during my internship at FIRMINIQ, a health tech company, from May 2024 to June 2024. As an intern in the Big Data and DevOps team, I focused on expanding my knowledge of various AWS services and tools. Key areas of work included:

* **AWS Kinesis**: Conducted in-depth research and provided insights into its application and integration.
* **SSO Services**: Explored the conjunction of Single Sign-On services with third-party tools.
* **Command Line Interfaces (CLIs)**: Strengthened my command on various CLIs through practical tasks.
* **Automation Scripts**: Developed multiple scripts to streamline organizational workflows.
* **Terraform, ECS, EC2**: Created documentation on the usage and implementation of Terraform, Amazon ECS, and EC2.

This experience provided a solid foundation in Big Data and DevOps, and I'm keen to explore the intersection of these skills with machine learning applications.
