# firminiq-intern-2024
This repository contains my work from an internship at FIRMINIQ (May-Jun 2024) in the Big Data and DevOps team. It includes research on AWS Kinesis, SSO services, CLIs, and automation scripts, along with documentation on Terraform, ECS, and EC2. This experience enhanced my skills in Big Data, DevOps, and automation.
